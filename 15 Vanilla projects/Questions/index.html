              <span class="question2 ">  Do You Suppport Local Farmers? </span>
                <i class="myBtn2 fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i>

                <div class="answer2 displayNone">
                    We support local farmers because supporting local farmers means supporting the local economy, which is major for any city. Money that is spent with local farmers and growers stays close to home and is reinvested with business and services within the community. It creates a cycle of local support!

            <div class="container3">
            <span class="question3 "> Do You Use Organic Ingredients?</span>
                <i class="myBtn3 fa-solid fa-square-plus"></i>
                <div class="answer3 displayNone">
                    We do use organic ingredients. Plants grown organically are found to contain a higher level of vital antioxidant vitamins than non-organic plants. Because they are grown without herbicides and pesticides, their organic ingredients are also free from that contamination, which means the same for your skin and body.
